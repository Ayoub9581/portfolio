This very website you're now watching. I wanted something fast and with good SEO for my portfolio It reads data from markdown files, so it's super easy for me to keep adding Portfolio items as I keep developing stuff. It also has a cool dark mode switch since I couldn't decide between a dark or light design.

i'm building my peronal portfolio using :

### React.js , MongoDB , Django , Webpack, Babel
